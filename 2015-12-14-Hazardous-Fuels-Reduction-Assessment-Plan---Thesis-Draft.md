# 1 Executive Summary

## 1.1 General Project Description

This Forest Fuels Treatment Program is designed to assess the time, disturbance impact, and cost efficiency of current fuel reduction technologies as applied to specific management styles within private, federal, and reservation mixed conifer timberland ownership in California. 

As of this writing, the State of California is experiencing its fourth consecutive year of drought. Increased in-woods fuel loading (NOTE:  I'm not sure if this is true) derived from post 1900 forest service fire suppression policy and changing climate patterns, have contributed towards an increased frequency of high intensity, high coverage wildland fires (NOTE:  paper reference?). 

In addition, depressed domestic timber demand from the 2007 housing bust coupled with management restrictions from the California Forest Practice Rules and Northern Spotted Owl and other wildlife protection policy have depreciated the both the demand and supply of wood from private land. Forest Service policy shift have similarly limited the removal of timber products from the forest (NOTE:  huh????). These factors have depressed the processing capacity (NOTE:  loss of timber production) of the existing california mill structure, a drop from ___mbf to ___ mbf over a seven year period. 

These factors contribute towards a need for alternative means of forest fuel removal or reorientation. Strong policy interest in developing alternative wood to energy fuels or alternative wood product markets (pulp, paper, osb, osm, nanocellulose) are underway but have not yet been fully realized. As such, current fuel treatment options are severely limited to ____ general options: In field mastication, mastication and removal, in field burning, and other. New technologies are constantly being developed to operate within the confines of each of these management restriction and this report will provide a quantitative assessment of currently available mechanical and biological options.  

Ignoring operator quality and performance and local vegetation type. 

## 1.2 Management Objectives

The management objectives covered by this project represent significant ecological, economic, and qualitative values and concerns expressed by the landowners to achieve fire hazard reduction while enhancing wildlife, aesthetic and recreational values. The applications reviewed under this project will be applicable to any forest landowner throughout the state whom are unable to fall and treat forestland in a traditional sense either due to insufficient scale and small margin of profit or access to a material intake facility. 

## 1.3 Analysis Methodology

Vegetation, fuel composition, and soil disturbance were monitored before and after treatment. Geolocation, activity, and cost data was also collected during the operational period of each type of equipment. Qualitative remarks on overall operating conditions were also collected through in person interviews.

Utilizing geospatial data, we are able to location per unit time 

The analytical approach of this project is to use vegetation data as a platform to leverage time and motion efficiency of the various platforms. We assess the efficacy of each equipment in treatment rate, treatment completeness, treatment disturbance impact, and associated costs. 

 under different slope conditions

## 1.4 Management Options

A variety of mechanical and biological treatments were considered for this study. Variability of vegetation type and slope conditions impact performance.

# 2 General Site Description

## 2.1 Project Area Description

The project covered locations distributed throughout the southern california region. The primary location of this project was based in Shaver Lake, CA on the Ely Mountain tract under the management and ownership of Southern California Edison. The project area covered ____ acres of varying vegetation types???? 

The site has a high level of recreational use and occupancy with a nearby Shaver Lake Campground hosting up to ____ people a year. In addition, ___ miles of established hiking trails are distributed throughout the project site. The site is limited, however based on its geographic location to access to traditional timber markets. The closest wood processing facility is in ____ with another at ____.  Recent drought conditions have also resulted in an outbreak of bark beetle attack and mortality roughly ballparked at 25%. Due to the non-timber component of this project, this project did not fall under the purview of the california forest practice rules, but all equivalent considerations were given for watercourse and other critical disturbance features. 

Supplemental treatments were conducted at San Bernardino National Forest in Big Bear, CA and the Santa Rosa Cahuilla Band of Indians in Santa Rosa, CA. 

## 2.2 Management History

The Southern California Edison Company company operates under the forest practice rules. The most recent harvest plan ELY was approved in 2010 with operations in ____. 

## 2.3 Adjacent Land Management

# 7 Preferred Alternative

The USDA Forest Service, in conjunction with the UC Berkeley Center for Forestry, and other partners, is sponsoring a series of hazardous fuels treatment demonstrations (demos) at strategic locations in central and southern California. Target audiences include fire agencies, natural resource managers, electric utilities, water conservation districts, homeowner associations, fire safe councils, county and city planning departments, fuels treatment contractors, and other stakeholders. Treatment demos will be one week in duration at each location (three to four locations total) and will provide equipment vendors the opportunity to demonstrate innovative equipment and techniques that might not be currently utilized in a local area. Equipment and techniques used for the demos will be monitored for effectiveness, efficiency, cost, and resource impacts (e.g., soil compaction and disturbance). Once completed, results of the demos will be synthesized and disseminated to previously identified target audiences and others.
